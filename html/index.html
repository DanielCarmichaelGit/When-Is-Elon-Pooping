              Elon once famously said,
              <em
                >"At least 50% of my tweets were made on a porcelain
                throne."</em
              >
              <br /><br />
              Our aim is to exploit this admission, and extrapolate upon Elon's
              tweet history, to find out what everyone is dying to know:

          To help us solve this question, we had to gather data, <strong>lots of it.</strong>

        <p>
          This "bubble chart" shows every tweet Elon has made in 2021. (Retweets & replies not included)
          <br><br>
          Left to right is every day of the year so far and top to bottom is every hour of the day.
          <br><br>
          The bigger the circle, the more tweets that were made within the same hour.
          <br><br>
          Notice the lack of activity between 5:00 a.m. and Noon, and the clusters of activity in the afternoon.
          <br><br>
          We started seeing <strong>patterns...</strong> But what did it all mean?

          <p>It is said that the average person poops about 
            <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/american-gut-check#Toilet-consensus-" target="_blank">once a day</a>, in the morning or in the afternoon.
            <br><br>
            To apply this knowledge to Elon's tweet habits, we needed a different perspective.

          Here we have Elon's total tweet count for every hour of 2021.
          <br><br>
          Now the <strong>mountains</strong> and <strong>valleys</strong> really start to stand out.
          <br><br>
          <strong class="stronger">So what does it all mean?</strong><br><br>
          It means Elon is likely an afternoon dumper. Lets walk through his day:
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>7:00am - <a href="https://finty.com/us/daily-routines/elon-musk/" target="_blank">Wake up</a></li>
            <li>7:00am - 12:00pm - Elon is likely working hard, putting in the crucial morning hours with his undivided attention</li>
            <li>12:00pm - 4:00pm - This is our magic <b>HIGH</b> tweet frequency, afternoon dump window</li>
            <li>4:00pm - 12:00am - More work, settling down into the evening as night approaches</li>
            <li>12:00am - 4:00am - This is the second highest spike period, our guess is that during many nights, Elon is working overtime and likely sending out "i'm too tired to think straight" tweets</li>
            <li>4:00am - 7:00am - Sleep... Mostly</li>
          </ul>

            <p>Elon tweets at many different times, but if you see him tweet between 2-4pm,<br>Elon is pooping.</p>
